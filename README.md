Hi all!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Greg and I'm currently a student studying Science in Information Technology.
I only just joined GitHub and found out about their student developer pack which is extremely exciting!
I am brand new and do not currently have any projects but some suggestions and beginner projects would be a wonderful start.
I would love to meet new people in programming fields and other IT fields.
If there are ways to contact others through GitHub such as an instant messaging service, please feel free to reach out, my username is grflip!
Hope to make some new friends!
